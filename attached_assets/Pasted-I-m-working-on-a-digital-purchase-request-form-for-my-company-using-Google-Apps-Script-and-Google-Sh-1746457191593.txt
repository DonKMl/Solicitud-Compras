I'm working on a digital purchase request form for my company using Google Apps Script and Google Sheets. Here's the full context and what I need:

## ‚úÖ Objective:
Create a functional and mobile-optimized web application that allows users to submit purchase requests through a dynamic HTML form. The form data must be sent and recorded automatically into a Google Sheets document, organized by site (sede).

---

## üìã Form Fields (with field type):

1. **Name** (short answer)
2. **Position** (short answer)
3. **Department / Area** (dropdown):
   - STT
   - Maintenance
   - Quality
   - Packaging
   - Stationery
   - Logistics
   - IT
4. **Site / Sede** (dropdown):
   - Main Site (Sales Point)
   - Plant
   - Chimila
   - Concentrates
   - Cartagena
5. **Type of Request** (dropdown):
   - Purchase Order
   - Service Order
6. **Justification** (dropdown):
   - New Purchase
   - Repurchase
   - Stock Depletion
7. **Product Name** (short answer)
8. **Quantity** (short answer, allow numbers and letters, e.g. "1000kg")
9. **Specification** (short answer)
10. **Add Product** button to allow multiple items before submitting the form.
11. **Submit Form** button to register all entered items to Google Sheets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements:

- When a product is added, it should be saved in a temporary table on the page.
- When submitting the form, all products should be submitted together along with user data (name, position, etc.).
- Upon form submission, the script must:
  - Automatically create or use an existing tab in Google Sheets based on the selected "Sede".
  - Insert each product on a separate row with the form metadata (name, position, etc.).
  - Add a column called "Status" with the value "New" for each row.
- The "Status" column must show:
  - "New" in light red
  - "In Process" in yellow
  - "Completed" in green
  (These styles can be applied manually in the spreadsheet for now.)

---

## üì± Mobile Optimization:

- The form should be responsive and fully mobile-optimized.
- On mobile, the input zoom issue should be minimized using CSS (`font-size: 16px;`).
- Layout should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

---

## üñºÔ∏è Additional:

- Add a logo image at the top of the form before the title "Purchase Request". The image is named `logo inverlache.jpg`.

---

## üîí Integration Notes:

- The Google Sheet is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c3FV-QxtJtzxZHClYFeYa9UkE-bheHHrKTss56JBAx0
- Script should use `doGet()` to render the form.
- Data must be appended to the correct sheet based on the selected "Sede".

Can you help me write the full HTML, CSS and Google Apps Script (`Code.gs`) to make this functional?
